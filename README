Kohelet 3

1. Everything has an appointed season, and there is a time for every matter under the heaven. 
2. A time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot that which is planted. 
3. A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break and a time to build. 	 
4. A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time of wailing and a time of dancing. 
5. A time to cast stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. 
6. A time to seek and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to cast away. 	
7. A time to rend and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak. 
8. A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.

What will be here:

- Settings for the heating for both churches 
- internal website for "my" choir the "Oelberg-Chor'

1. The parish needs some help
2. I wanna improve my programming-skills
